# GGM - Grin GPU Miner

Miner supports all AMD and NVIDIA 6GB cards. 6GB cards need Linux or Windows7 at the moment because Windows reserves too much memory on those cards. Only GPU PoW Cuckaroo29 is supported at this time. 

RTX 2080 and RTX 2080Ti are fastest, OpenCL code for AMD cards is being optimized. Cheap Celeron CPU is not recommended for many cards on the system.
